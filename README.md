# Timetable_To_Calendar
The aim of this repository is to make a script which converts an image (screenshot) of the timetable of my university (VIT) to a calendar which can be synced with my personal/work google calendar with a simple click. 

Currently the project takes a user inputted csv file containing the timetable and converts it into a calendar which sync with your google calendar as a secondary calendar.

Please note that this project uses Google's Calendar API, you will need to pip install the required libraries accordingly.
Inorder to get the credentials of the API you may create a google cloud account and avail the services to enable the API.

Further Documentation will be posted soon.
