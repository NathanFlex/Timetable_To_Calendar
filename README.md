# Timetable_To_Calendar
The aim of this repository is to make a script which converts an image (screenshot) of the timetable of my university (VIT) to a calendar which can be synced with my personal/work google calendar with a simple click. 

Please note that this project uses Google's Calendar API, you will need to pip install the required libraries accordingly.
Inorder to get the credentials of the API you will require a google cloud account and avail the services to enable the API.

Further Documentation will be posted soon.
