# Timetable_To_Calendar
The aim of this repository is to make a script which converts an image (screenshot) of the timetable of my university (VIT) to a calendar which can be synced with my personal/work google calendar with a simple click. 

Please note that this project uses Google's Calendar API
Inorder to get the credentials of the API you may create a google cloud account and avail the services to enable the API.

Further Documentation of the setup will be posted soon.
